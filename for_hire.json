        "body": "Hello, im looking for some expert in this field to make an automatation browing bot. The bot will grab appointments when available on webiste, and keep trying again and again 24x7.\n\nI have made a video of the website and what it should do (without some technical aspects, because those could only be explained in words, and seen while programming the bot).\n\nThe bot is for spanish website, so there are many provinces, and different appointments for specific need.\n\nFirst of all, the bot is browsing orientated, it has some forms to fill like the data, and the telephone number and emails ( for these two we will discuss later what is the best method to implement those to automate), so you need api integration or form integration knowledge too, if thats how its called, so one dont have to put manually that data in every browser tab, for example\u00a0[https://app.appsmith.com/](https://app.appsmith.com/)\u00a0, ive been using this for a guy that already had a bot, and all i did was fill the form and the moment i pressed ok, the bot would automatically start to find appointment with that data, if we can use the same method it would be nice.\n\nThis website works with only spanish proxies, we need to buy best and fast proxies. When you try few times or even 2-3 times, the website detects the automatation and it blocks your ip, so we need the proxies rotation to takle that, avoid websites securities and blockage to have an efficient bot.\n\nI dont know much about it or how it works or how its implemented, but ive been working with a guy that had a bot, and all i did was fill that form, with all the data that this website requires when u try it manually, the document number, name, year birth, a telephone number and a email, and on the background the bot would start to find the appointment, i knwo this because he had a telegram bot implemented, and if appointment already existen on that document number (only 1 appointment can be existing on 1 document number), telegram bot would send me a message that this name and document number had an appointment already, and otherwise when the bot itself grabs the appointment, it sends me the information of the appointment. (I can show you later the bot and the telegram bot).\n\nThere are many different type of appointments, different provinces cities, so it will have many tabs or searchings at the same time.\n\nI need the best and most quick bot as possible, there is a lot of competition and bots involved, i dont know how this website works, because i need really to talk with someone when they accept the job before accepting the job and telling me their budget.\n\nI dont have problem with the budget, as long as the project is well build and does what i want.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me for any inquiries, somehow, i dont knwo how its possible here.\n\nthis is the website:\u00a0[https://icp.administracionelectronica.gob.es/icpplus/index.html](https://icp.administracionelectronica.gob.es/icpplus/index.html)\u00a0(you need spanish vpn to log)\n\n[https://www.transfernow.net/dl/20240810ndneaK52](https://www.transfernow.net/dl/20240810ndneaK52)\u00a0this is my video interacting and explaning the website.",
